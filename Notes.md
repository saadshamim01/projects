[DevOps](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/devops-tutorial/what-is-devops) is a culture that allows the development and the operations team to work together. This results in continuous development, testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle.

An approach aims to synergize the efforts of the development and operations teams to accelerate the delivery of software products, with a minimal failure rate. Include how DevOps is a value-added practice, where development and operations engineers join hands throughout the product or service lifecycle, right from the design stage to the point of deployment.



DevOps Steps

- **Plan** - Initially, there should be a plan for the type of application that needs to be developed. Getting a rough picture of the development process is always a good idea.
- **Code** - The application is coded as per the end-user requirements. 
- **Build** - Build the application by integrating various codes formed in the previous steps.
- **Test** - This is the most crucial step of the application development. Test the application and rebuild, if necessary.
- **Integrate** - Multiple codes from different programmers are integrated into one.
- **Deploy** - Code is deployed into a cloud environment for further usage. It is ensured that any new changes do not affect the functioning of a high traffic website.
- **Operate** - Operations are performed on the code if required.
- **Monitor** - Application performance is monitored. Changes are made to meet the end-user requirements.

#### Development Methodologies

###### Agile

[Agile](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/agile-scrum-tutorial/what-is-agile) is a software development methodology that focuses on iterative, incremental, small, and rapid releases of software, along with customer feedback. It addresses gaps and conflicts between the customer and developers.

A project management methodology characterized by building products using short cycles of work that allow for rapid production and constant revision.

###### Kanban

A visual approach to project management where teams create physical representations of their tasks, often using sticky notes on whiteboards (or online apps). Tasks are moved through predetermined stages to track progress and identify common roadblocks.

###### Scrum

A PM methodology in which a small team is led by a Scrum master, whose main job is to clear away all obstacles to completing work. Work is done in short cycles called sprints, but the team meets daily to discuss current tasks and roadblocks.

###### Adaptive Project Framework (APF)

A project management methodology that grew from the idea that most IT projects canâ€™t be managed using traditional PM methods. Work is done in stages and evaluated after each one.

###### Extreme Project Management (XPM)

A PM methodology where the project plan, budget, and final deliverable can be changed to fit evolving needs, no matter how far along the project is.
