## Collections

Python has 4 collection data types: 

- **List**: A list is declared in square brackets, it is mutable, stores duplicate values and elements can be accessed using indexes.
- **Typle**: A tuple is ordered and immutable in nature, although duplicate entries can be there inside a tuple.
- **Sets**: A set is unordered and declared in square brackets. It is not indexed and does not have duplicate entries as well.
- **Dictionary**: A dictionary has key value pairs and is mutable in nature. We use square brackets to declare a dictionary.

- It also has specialized data structures which basically covers for the shortcomings of the four data types.
