## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) ** provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances. **

- Can be launched with minute,

### EC2 Instance Types

#### General
- balance between compute, memory, networking resources.

#### Compute optimized instance
- ideal for compute-bound application which use high performance processors.

- Compute optimized applications: ideal for ideal perforamce web server. Ideal for batch processing and multiple transactions.

- Compute intense application: server, dedicated gaming server.

Example: web application, gaming servers.

#### Memory optimized instances

- Used when large dataset in memory. Dataset is loaded before performing any action on it.

- Processing of large unprocessed data.

#### Accelerated Computing Instances

- Uses accelerators to perform complex:  floating point number, graphics processing or data pattern matching.

#### Storage Optimized Instance

- Large read/write in local storage

- ** Examples of workloads suitable for storage optimized instances include distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. **

- IOPS: Input/output operations per second, measure performance of storage device.


## Amazon EC2 Pricing

#### On-Demand

- For short term, irregular workloads, cannot be interupted, no upfront cost, pay as you go.
