## Introduction

Topics discussed:

- Well Architectured Framework
- Six Benefits of cloud computing

### The Well-Architected Framework is based on five pillars:

- Operational excellence: Operational excellence is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

- Security: The Security pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

- Reliability: Reliability involves recovering from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues

- Performance efficiency: Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

- Cost optimization: Cost optimization is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
