## Infrastructure

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** 

- Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 
- IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** 

- Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 
- This helps you be more efficient as you donâ€™t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** 

- Provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. 
- In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. 
- With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software
