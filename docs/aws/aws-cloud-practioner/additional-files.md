## Infrastructure

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** 

- Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 
- IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** 

- Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 
- This helps you be more efficient as you donâ€™t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
