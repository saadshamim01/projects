#### Migration Steps and Tools

1. Migration assessment analysis 
2. Schema conversion to a target database platform 
3. SQL statement and application code conversion
4. Data migration
5. Testing of converted database and application code
6. Setting up replication and failover scenarios for data migration to the target platform 
7. Setting up monitoring for a new production environment and go live with the target environment
