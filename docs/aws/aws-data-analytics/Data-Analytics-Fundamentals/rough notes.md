cannot change kpl value without restarting.

Athena cannot query from redshift, they r alternative

REdshift

First RUN then ANalyze, once a day is enough

Use Redshift Spectrum to join table with S3. export schma

IOT Core can directly load into s3

Secuirty: Write id without hypen

EBS encrypytion over LUKS

RPC encypts in transit not at rest

EMR master must be placed in seperate security group.

kcl subsequence is used for checkpointing

You cant load data from kinesis firehose to redshift directly, u need to store in s3 bucket then use copy command to load it in redshift

For kinesis stream to write to s3, u need to write custom code, takes time & not simple

kinesis api faster -> deaggregate question

HEC - splunk

SucceedProcessing: number of records written into Lambda

Redshift: Cannot change the encoding type after has been created 



- My exam was probably 90% questions on **Kinesis, Glue, EMR, and Redshift**, some on Athena and Quicksight, a few on DynamoDB, DMS, and an as-expected amount on S3. I underestimated the amount of questions that would appear from the security domain, so make sure you know security and how it relates to each of the various services like the back of your hand.
