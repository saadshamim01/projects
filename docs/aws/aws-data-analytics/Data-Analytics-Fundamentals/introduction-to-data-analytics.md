#### Benefits of data analytics

- **Customer Personalization**: 
- **Fraud Detection:**
- **Security Threat Detection:**
- **User Behaviour:**
- **Financial Modeling and Forecasting:** 
- **Real-Time Alerting:**

Big Data Problems: Massive Datasets, blazing speed, rapid Insights.

- Effective data analysis solution requires storage, analyze in near real time with low latency and yield high value returns.
- Factors considered in data analytics: volume & speed
- Five key challenges: **volume**, **velocity**, **variety**, **veracity**, and **value**.

#### Data Analysis Solution Components

**Raw Data : Ingest Collects -> Store -> Process Analyze -> Consume : Answers & Insights**

- The **collect** component is where the services assemble data from many sources.
- The **store** component stores data in repositories.

- The **process** component is where services manipulate data into needed forms.

- The **consume** component is where data is presented in the required formats.

#### 5Vs of data

**Volume**	 **Velocity** 	**Variety**	**Veracity**	**Value**

- Knowing where data comes from
- Knowing options to process data
- Knowing what to learn from data

Veracity -> Provenance: Knowing the chain of custody for data.
