Java Compilation

**Gradle:** Gradle is an open-source tool that helps us to create software with mechanization. This tool is widely used for the creation of different kinds of software due to its high performance. It works on Java and a Groovy-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for developing the project structure. Gradle supports the creation of mobile and web applications with testing and deploying on various platforms. With its functionality, it is preferred as an official tool for developing Android applications. 

**Maven:** Maven is an open-source project management tool that helps us to create different software in the lifecycle used by this tool. This tool focuses on the standardization (i.e.) development of the software in a standard layout within a short duration of time. With this, we can create Java projects but is compatible to be used for other languages too. Maven uses Extensible Markup language(XML) for the structuring of the application. 

| Basis               | Gradle                                                       | Maven                                                        |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Based on            | Gradle is based on developing domain-specific language projects. | Maven is based on developing pure Java language-based software. |
| Configuration       | It uses a Groovy-based Domain-specific language(DSL) for creating project structure. | It uses Extensible Markup Language(XML) for creating project structure. |
| Focuses on          | Developing applications by adding new features to them.      | Developing applications in a given time limit.               |
| Performance         | It performs better than maven as it optimized for tracking only current running task. | It does not create local temporary files during software creation hence uses large time. |
| Java Compilation    | It avoids compilation.                                       | It is necessary to compile.                                  |
| Usability           | It is a new tool, which requires users to spend a lot of time to get used to it. | This tool is a known tool for many users and is easily available. |
| Customization       | This tool is highly customizable as it supports a variety of IDEâ€™s. | This tool serves a limited amount of developers and is not that customizable. |
| Languages supported | It supports software development in Java, C, C++, and Groovy. | It supports software development in Scala, C#, and Ruby.     |
