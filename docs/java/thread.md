Inheritence (IS-A)

Aggrefation (HAS-A)



- Code reuse is also best achieved by aggregation when there is no is-a relationship.
- Inheritance should be used only if the relationship is-a is maintained throughout the lifetime of the objects involved; otherwise, aggregation is the best choice.

## Multithreading

In Java, Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU. A thread in Java is a ***lightweight process\*** requiring fewer resources to create and shares the process resources.

Few more advantages of Multithreading are:

- Multithreading saves time as you can perform multiple operations together.
- The threads are independent, so it does not block the user to perform multiple operations at the same time and also, if an exception occurs in a single thread, it does not affect other threads.

Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :

- Extending the Thread class
- Implementing the Runnable Interface

#### Life Cycle of Thread

1. New
2. Runnable
3. Running
4. Non-Runnable (Blocked)
5. Terminated

#### MultiTasking

Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:

**Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)**

- Each process has an address in memory. In other words, each process allocates a separate memory area.
- A process is heavyweight.
- Cost of communication between the process is high.
- Switching from one process to another requires some time for saving and loading [registers](https://www.javatpoint.com/register-memory), memory maps, updating lists, etc.

**Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)**

- Threads share the same address space.
- A thread is lightweight.
- Cost of communication between the thread is low.

#### Thread Class vs Runnable Interface

- If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
- We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
- Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.

Few more advantages of Multithreading are:

- Multithreading saves time as you can perform multiple operations together.
- The threads are independent, so it does not block the user to perform multiple operations at the same time and also, if an exception occurs in a single thread, it does not affect other threads.



## **Thread Creation**

While multithreading in Java, you can create a thread using two ways:

1. By extending Thread class
2. By implementing the Runnable interface

## **What is Thread Class?**

Thread class provides the methods and constructors to create and perform operations on a thread. Thread class extends Object class and implements the Runnable interface.



- hread()
- Thread(String name)
- Thread(Runnable r)
- Thread(Runnable r,String name) --> MOST COMMON
