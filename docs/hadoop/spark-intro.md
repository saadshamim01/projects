Apache Spark is never the replacement to **[Hadoop](https://www.edureka.co/blog/top-hadoop-developer-skills/).** It is another processing layer like **MapReduce.**

Apache Spark is the **lightning-fast** cluster computing framework that provides the interface to program the entire cluster so as to achieve implicit **data** **parallelism** and **fault-tolerance.**



- Sparkâ€™s major building blocks are the **[RDDs](https://www.edureka.co/blog/rdd-using-spark/)**(Resilient Distributed Datasets) and the [**Dataframes**](https://www.edureka.co/blog/dataframes-in-spark/).
- Components in Apache Spark which are mentioned below:
  - [**SparkSQL**](https://www.edureka.co/blog/spark-sql-tutorial/)
  - [**SparkML-Lib**](https://www.edureka.co/blog/spark-mllib/)
  - [**Spark GraphX**](https://www.edureka.co/blog/spark-graphx/)
  - **SparkR**
  - **[Spark Streaming](https://www.edureka.co/blog/spark-streaming/)**

Big data is a term for collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.

Big Data Charecterstics

- Volume
- Velocity
- Variety: Audio, Videos, Sensor Data

Limitations of Existing Data Analytics Architecture

- Storage 
- Data arhieved
- Only 10% of 2PB is available for BI.

Combined Storage Computer Layer

- Both processing and storage
- No need to arhieve
- Complete data available for BI.
