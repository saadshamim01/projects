### AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

- Helps guide organization for cloud migration

- AWS CAF has 6 areas of focus called Perspectives.

**Business capabilities: Business, People, Governance**
**Technical capabilities; Platform, Security, Operations**

- The Business Perspective ensures that IT aligns with business needs and that IT investments link to key business results.

- The People Perspective supports development of an organization-wide change management strategy for successful cloud adoption.

- The Governance Perspective focuses on the skills and processes to align IT strategy with business strategy. This ensures that you maximize the business value and minimize risks.

- The Platform Perspective includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.

- The Security Perspective ensures that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control, and agility.

- The Operations Perspective helps you to enable, run, use, operate, and recover IT workloads to the level agreed upon with your business stakeholders.

### Migration Strategies (6Rs)

- When migrating the company can select strategies;

**Rehosting
Replatforming
Refactoring/re-architecting
Repurchasing
Retaining
Retiring**

- Rehosting also known as “lift-and-shift” involves moving applications without changes.

- Replatforming, also known as “lift, tinker, and shift,” involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.

- Refactoring (also known as re-architecting) involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features.

- Repurchasing involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model. Migration to salesforce.com

- Retaining consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or, work that can be postponed until a later time.

- Retiring is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.
