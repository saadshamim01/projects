## Introduction

- We will use tools to monitor the performance of the business:

1. CloudWatch
2. CloudTrail
3. Trusted Advisor

If some resource is getting over utlised (EC2), it will automatically scale.

### CloudWatch

- Allows you to monitor AWS infrasture and resources (real time monitoring)

- Variable tied to resource. Ex: Cleaning after 100 mugs; owner can be alerted using ** CloudWatch alarm: by setting a threshold or in development if developer forgets to stop instances, cloudwatch will shut it down. **

- Can be integrated with SMS aswell.

- CloudWatch dashboard allows you to monitor all resources from a single page in real time. ** Can access metics from a central location **

- Gain visibility in applications, infrastructure and services -> Reduce MTTR and improve TCO.

MTTR: Mean time to resolution
TCO: Total cost of ownership

- Using insight to optimize application and opperational resources.
